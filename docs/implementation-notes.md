# react-native-dp3t-sdk implementation notes

Native module is based on [bob](https://github.com/react-native-community/bob) and accepts all choices it made.

I don't know Kotlin, but I have background experience in Java. It is close enough and Android Studio does a decent initial conversion on copy-paste, and [React Native docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/native-modules-android) are OK.

I don't know Swift (nor Obj-C). iOS bindings are based on [React Native docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/native-modules-ios) with a lot of help from [this post](https://teabreak.e-spres-oh.com/swift-in-react-native-the-ultimate-guide-part-1-modules-9bb8d054db03) (thank you!)
